AssetControlUCS-URC

communciates with assets
control requests, mobility, subsystems
translated to correct messages and communication protocols
uses dds or itc for ipc mechanism as required

Atlas?
AVProtocol
Interfaces
    small, just boost udp stuff?

RadioConfigServiceUCS
vs
RadioConfigUCS
    i think these are avvis only?
    listening for radio config messages
    no duh

SimUCSMDE-URC
    not mentioned in sdd right now, should it be added?

UCSMDE-URC
    seems to be mostly old stuff?
    has the generic pub sub stuff
        that i had to modify to get itc
ui
Plugins
    allow communication to specific vehicle types? puma raven vs pix hawk
    comms over itc
    receive itc messages? for avvis
    relationship with pluginloader

pluginloader calls main functions of plugins
    then the plugins wait for incoming messages, and rebroadcast to our stuff?
        how, dds or itc
        into what stuff, the vis/translator?
        genericpubsub related to these most likely

where do these sit exactly in reference to the translator/vis
looking at the csci detailed design
nic means from the robots and assets
    to the vis then the plugins?
    or to the plugins then the vis?
does avvis ever use dds anymore

platform controller seems outdated
    what was it replaced by?
    what was its function?
ddsi vs dds?
split repo stuf???

what does ptz mean
