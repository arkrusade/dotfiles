mobility
stabilizer
arm


does this happen before or after configureAssets?
    since that sets all the subsystemIDs

acquire in jaus translator
dont emit yet
start timer? for mobility defined in subsystems
checking subsystem ids
    checking against newSUbsystem emits
subsystemidrecvd

mKnownSubsystems


login -> acquire
start acquire in translator
param is us? some sort of ucs thing
tr checks for mobility subsystem id
    get id of mobility from configparser, config support
    mAssetConfig->mSubsystems
    var of AssetUCS
if there, send control request for mobility
when control reported, finish acquiring


stopped at jausvistranslator::acquire
