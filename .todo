general
    figure out best place for home git
    ssh add before git push
    move to zsh
    figure out good way to separate environments
        just git branches is probably not good enough
        the 'master' should have universal stuff
        env specific aliases
            config file that specifies 'name' for different envs?
            then imports a different file based on that name

bash
    get aliases from oh my zsh
    make sure profile/rc are split correctly
        nothing in profile except getting exports and alias files
        and maybe files for env, functions


figure out best editor
    universal
    c/c++
    html/xml
    python
    javascript
    bash
    txt
    word?
    tex?
    markdown
        also learn markdown

vim
    move to next method
    camelCase and snake_case (small w) words 
        leader w
        leader W
    surround highlighted with brackets/paren/quotes
        cib like ci"
            finds next (only if not in)?
    use previous indent level for new indent (o/O), maybe not for O
        backspace deleting 4 spaces?
    joining
        g<c-j> vs gJ
        

    see folding near numbers
    persistent marks and folding
    enable certain key combos 
        (<c-cr> vs j, <c-i> vs <tab>)
    insert line break
        nah, just use i<cr>
        <s-cr> and <s-c-cr> to break line up/down
    commenting
        language dependant 
        gc or <c-/> 

    split a macro line into separate operations
    change order of parameters
        goes to comma
        last comma in line?
            change from next comma until the comma afterwards?
        a, b -> b, a 
        a, b, c -> a, c, b
a, b, c
(a, b, c)
b, , c

f,
b
"xdW
W
P

f,"xdBW"zdB"xPB"zP
$F,"xdBW"zdiw"xP;"zP




vscode
    path to vscode_vimrc
