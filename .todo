general
    ssh add before git push
    move to zsh
    figure out good way to separate environments
        just git branches is probably not good enough
        the 'master' should have universal stuff
        others should have specific aliases
            config file that specifies 'name' for different envs?
            then imports a different file based on that name

bash
    get aliases from oh my zsh
    make sure profile/rc are split correctly
        nothing in profile except getting exports and alias files
        and maybe files for env, functions


figure out best universal editor

vim
    camelCase and snake_case (small w) words
    surround highlighted with brackets/paren/quotes
    use previous indent level for new indent (o/O), maybe not for O
    change order of parameters
        goes to comma
        last comma in line?
            change from next comma until the comma afterwards?
        a, b -> b, a 
        a, b, c -> a, c, b
a, b, c
(a, b, c)
b, , c

f,
b
"xdW
W
P

f,"xdBW"zdB"xPB"zP
$F,"xdBW"zdiw"xP;"zP


    see folding near numbers
    persistent marks and folding
    enable certain key combos (<c-cr> vs j, <c-i> vs <tab>)
        then, add
            <s-cr> and <s-c-cr> to break line up/down
            <c-/> for commenting
    split a macro line into separate operations


vscode
    path to vscode_vimrc
    universal settings.json
    list of extensions
        and their settings.json?
